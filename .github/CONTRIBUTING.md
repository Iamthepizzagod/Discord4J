## Submitting an Issue
Issues can be used to request a feature or report issues with Discord4J. When openning an issue, make sure to follow the [template](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) in order to allow us to understand your issue and provide help if necessary. 

While you may ask questions about using Discord4J through issues, it is generally easier to do so in the [Discord4J Discord Server](https://discord.gg/NxGAeCY).

## Submitting a Pull Requests
For all but trivial changes, it is usually best to open an issue to provide context for the bug you are fixing or feature you are adding. Make sure to reference this issue in your Pull Request. As with issues, make sure to follow the [template](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

When submitting a Pull Request, remember the following:
* Make sure to submit your PR to the appropriate branch. If your change is general and not related to any other branch, submit it to `dev`.
* Ensure that all contributions are properly formatted according to the [project code style](https://github.com/Discord4J/meta).
* All patches submitted to Discord4J will be subject to [GNU LGPLv3](../LICENSE.txt).
